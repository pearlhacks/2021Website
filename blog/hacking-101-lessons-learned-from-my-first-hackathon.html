            <p class="h5">Advice from reflecting as a 4x hackathon organizer</p>
            <h5 class="h6">By Lindsay Zhou</h5>
            <hr>

            <p>I attended HackNC during October of my freshman year — barely two months after I’d written my first line
                of code in my life. At the time, I didn’t know a thing about hackathons. I persuaded my best friend to
                sign up with me, but she had something going on in the morning, so I ambled around alone in Venable Hall
                at UNC, trying to figure out what exactly I was supposed to do.</p>
            <p>Somehow, I entered a conversation with a group of other freshmen who were equally as confused as I was.
                We snowballed into a team of seven — eight, once my best friend was able to join us in the afternoon —
                and decided pretty early on that we were going to say “forget it” to the prizes because we’d be lucky to
                get a project done at all. It took us half the day to decide what we were going to work on before we
                settled on a text-based maze game in Java — a language thatonly two out of the eight of us knew because
                the rest of us were in Intro to Programming at UNC, which was taught in TypeScript at the time.</p>
            <h3>The Grind</h3>
            <p>The specifics of what happened after that were a blur as I tried to figure out Java, GitHub, and
                programming in general. Our maze project was... not the most beautiful project out there, which
                solidified our “forget it” approach to prizes. We took breaks to go to workshops and, of course, eat the
                free food that was provided. As night settled in, we relied on sugar from donuts, handfuls of Awake
                chocolates, and many cups of coffee to stay awake as we continued to plink away at the bugs plaguing our
                simple maze game.</p>
            <p>Around 2 or 3 in the morning, my teammates were ready to call it a night, but we had been stuck trying to
                code in a health (HP) system. Our maze game transformed into a tool for kids to learn math — as the
                player navigated the maze, monsters popped up at random, and only solving a simple math problem could
                vanquish the beasts. Answer wrong, and the player would lose health. However, we just couldn’t get the
                health mechanism to work. In fact, it was somehow crashing the rest of our game.</p>
            <p>While my team returned to their dorms to sleep, I found myself unable to pull away from the keyboard. I
                spent the entire night trying to implement the HP system alone in my dorm room. Looking back on it more
                than two years later, I can’t imagine why it was so complicated, but for freshman me with no coding
                experience, it was 8 AM by the time I’d gotten it figured out. I sent a text to my team letting them
                know it’d been fixed, and then I passed out.</p>
            <p>When I woke up again, it was 11:30 — past the project submission deadline. I ran back to Venable Hall to
                discover that my team had missed my text and submitted the version without the HP system from when we’d
                left off the previous night, which used hearts to measure health
                instead. Oddly enough, I wasn’t even upset. The heart system was more fluid for the gameplay, and I was
                just glad to have figured it out.</p>
            <h3>The Demo</h3>
            <p>When I say this project was ugly, I mean... Rather than updating the maze when the player made a move, it
                printed a new grid every time. The walls were made of vertical slashes (|) and underscores (_). It
                wasn’t hosted anywhere — we ran it in Java Eclipse when it was time to demo.We made sarcastic jokes
                about our project the entire weekend, calling ourselves the “Dream Team” ironically, and subsequently
                naming our project “Hello, Dream World.” If you want to take a look at exactly what our project was
                like, here’s the repo. But hey, we demoed nonetheless.</p>
            <p>We weren’t fooling anyone in thinking it was a prize-worthy project, but we demoed it with the same
                enthusiasm as any other group, using buzzy marketing words and introducing it as “a gamedesigned to help
                young children master basic math skills,” even though we knew no child would give our game longer than a
                glance, the way it looked. We also probably looked silly as an eight-person team when most other teams
                maxed out at four — the number of prizes that were allotted for each category. Still, we got one really
                enthusiastic judge that was excited for us for completing a project at all when we were all just
                starting out! Most importantly, we were happy.</p>
            <h3>From Hacker to Organizer</h3>
            <p>HackNC 2018 has been one of my favorite college experiences to date. That semester, I would go on to
                participate in three more hackathons — HackDuke at Duke University, HackGT at Georgia Tech, and Hack110,
                which was hosted by my Intro to Programming class. At none of these did I ever seriously compete for
                prizes. I just showed up for the atmosphere. (Okay, and the free stuff.) Hack110 was a particular
                personal success for me because I surprised myself with how much I’d actually learned during the
                semester!</p>
            <p>I loved the hackathon experience so much that I joined the organizing boards of two hackathons at my
                university — the Carolina Data Challenge and Pearl Hacks. Since then, I’ve gotten to handle budgets of
                over $50,000 and reach hundreds of participants across both events.</p>
            <p>With Pearl Hacks coming up in a
                month, I’ve been searching for tips to send to participants, many of whom are coming to Pearl Hacks for
                their first hackathon ever! However, when I Google for hackathon tips, many of the articles are geared
                towards winning. While winning prizes is a lot of fun, it does not have to be your main focus to have a
                great time, so here are a few non-technical tips to make the most out of your time at Pearl Hacks!</p>
            <h3>Know Your Goals</h3>
            <p>You can get a lot out of your hackathon experience, but there are only 24 hours of
                hacking, so it’s helpful to know what you want before you get started. You don’t need to have a 10-point
                plan or anything like that, but answering some broad questions for yourself can help you hit the ground
                running.</p>

            <h4>Do You Want to Compete for Prizes?</h4>
            <p>I hate putting this question first because I think hackathons are
                very valuable whether or not you’re there to compete, and I don’t want it to seem like competing has to
                be a
                priority. However, this is one of the first questions to figure out, whether your answer is yes or no!
            </p>
            <p>If
                your primary goal is to compete, that means you’ll probably spend the majority of your time coding,
                which
                limits the other events you can participate in. If not, you get a lot more time to attend workshops,
                network, and join fun events!</p>
            <p>Don’t worry if your answer changes midway through. There have been plenty of
                participants in the past who surprised themselves by completing a project, and there have been even more
                who
                decided partway through that they just weren’t feeling it. Either way, hackathons are flexible enough to
                allow a change of plans.</p>
            <h4>What Do You Want to Learn?</h4>
            <p>More specifically:
                <ul>
                    <li>Are you looking to brush up your
                        technical skills?</li>
                    <li>Are you seeking new career opportunities?</li>
                    <li>Do you just want to see what a hackathon is
                        like?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These are all valid reasons to go to hackathons!</p>
            <p>For those looking to improve their technical skills,
                working on a project is always a great option! Pearl Hacks has technical mentors that can help you out
                along
                the way, and programming is one of those things that’s just best learned by doing. However, if projects
                really aren’t your thing or you don’t have the full weekend to commit, you can also take a look at Pearl
                Hacks’ technical workshops and see if there are skills that interest you.</p>
            <p>Hackathons can also help you get
                your foot in the door while recruiting. Pearl Hacks holds a sponsorship fair where you can interact with
                representatives from our sponsor companies. You can also say hi to sponsors on the Pearl Hacks Discord
                via
                the <b>#chat-with-sponsors</b> channel or go to sponsored workshops. Some sponsors will be doubling as
                technical
                mentors too. If you’re planning on participating in a hackathon’s recruiting events, make sure you come
                prepared with an updated resume and an elevator pitch, and remember to respect the sponsors’ time!</p>
            <p>If you’re
                just going to a hackathon for the heck of it, that’s okay too! In that case, you can pick and choose
                events
                that are interesting to you. After all, the hackathon organizers are creating the event for you, and
                they
                want you to have the experience you want.</p>
            <h3>Talk to People!</h3>
            <p>We all know the stereotypical image of a programmer — a man slouched over a laptop in a dark room, typing
                away. By now, hopefully you’ve realized that this is not what programmers are like, and this is
                definitely
                not what hackathons are like!</p>
            <p>When we could host events in person, one of my favorite parts of being a
                hackathon director waswandering around the venue, striking up conversations with teams, playing board
                games
                with participants, and seeing what awesome projects people were working on. This is coming from a huge
                introvert. Take breaks when your social battery runs empty, but if you’re feeling up to it, it’s worth a
                shot to chat up other people!</p>
            <p>With the online format, it’s a lot harder to initiate conversations, but that
                doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Pearl Hacks 2021 will use Discord as a communication channel throughout
                our
                event, and that’s one way you can ping people who seem interesting! Take some time to check out the
                <b>#just-chatting channel</b> and spark a conversation. You can also introduce yourself in the <b>#team-building</b>
                channel if you’re looking for teammates or drop some links in the <b>#networking-channel</b> so people can keep
                up
                with you outside of the event. These channels are also great opportunities for you to scope around and
                see
                if there’s anybody you want to reach out to!I still keep in touch with some of the members from my first
                team at HackNC, and it’s always great to see what neat things people go on to do! Meeting people at a
                hackathon will make your time there a lot more fun and memorable.</p>
            <h3>Use the Hackathon as a Launching Point</h3>
            <p>Like
                most hackathons, Pearl Hacks is only a weekend long, so don’t expect your most polished work to come out of
                it. If you’re working on a project, focus on the big picture — the problem you’re trying to solve, and how
                your project addresses it. It’s better to have a rough, complete project than it is to have a polished one
                that doesn’t work because it’s only half done. It’s also better to have a half-finished project than none at
                all because you spent the whole time thinking about minute details. You can always build on the fine details
                later on if you decide to continue pursuing what you worked on, so take the weekend to crank out some
                code!</p>
                <p>This advice goes for non-project-related events at hackathons too! You’re not likely to build a lasting
                    relationship with anyone over one weekend, so follow up with people that you met if you want to stay
                    connected. 1–2 hour workshops are also not going to turn you into a master of any topic, so continue looking
                    for resources on your own for any subjects you’re interested in.</p>
                <p>Pearl Hacks is here to empower you to pursue
                    technology, but it’s still up to you to do the pursuing!</p>
